A: 
1. It is working, because I tested on Windows and on Linux with completly virgin environment.
2. Please follow the [how to use section ](https://github.com/jugo-amaryl/How_To_LevelUp_Your_AIsCommunicationSkill/blob/master/HowToUsePGP.md) step-by-step. With that, you won't notice any issue. 
3. I noticed many bugs with Kleopatra. On the Internet you can also find several bugs. Please make sure you follow my guide and in case of some issue happening, try to download another alternative tool or prepare a virgin environment with Oracle VirtualBox. Maybe it will require 40-50 minutes, but it will work.
4. Advice: save each items in a new folder to not mix different Keys.
