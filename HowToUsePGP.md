# How to use PGP decryption
---
### This is guide what I tested:
1. Get Kelopatra *(Easiest way if you google it. It works with Linux and windows too)*
2. Prepare My public Key, Reciever's Private Key & Passphare - *These are what I will send to you via e-mail.*
3. Import these PGP keys into Kleopatra / Clipboard -> Certificate import

3.1 Copy the Private Key and Add to Kleopatra

3.2 Copy the Public Key and Add to Kleopatra

3.3 Certify both *(if it is not done yet)*

3.4 Advice: do not mix keys with existing keys, it will make headache for you

4. Select and Copy the PGP message into Notepad [link is here](https://github.com/jugo-amaryl/How_To_LevelUp_Your_AIsCommunicationSkill/blob/master/TheTechnique_MyMethod.txt)
5. Kleopatra / Clipboard / *Decrypt/Verify* Notepad *(Maybe you need to paste the text, maybe it is enough if it is on the clipboard, depend on which version do you use)*
6. Input the Passphrase *(Double check what is on your clipboard, some Kleopatra version has bug, and you are not able to copy paste the Passphare - at least with Linux I noticed this issue)*
7. Copy my method for yourself
8. Remove stegaography, add Tabs as structure shows, and work can start

- Please note, Kleopatra mostly using the clipboard to reach the data. In case you selected a text, pressed CTRL+C (Copy), data will go to Clipboard. You will no need to paste it. Some versions of Kleopatra has a notepad for Encryption and Decryption. In this case you need to Paste (CTRL+V) the PGP message and click to Decrypt. 
- In case you would stuck with the process, here is a [Decryption tutorial link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwyYRFBcEsU) and an [Encryption tutorial link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAblt1Qt_ng) *(just to understand the whole process)* to watch DIY video, but you can search on youtube for more.
- PGPforWin is also a good software *(decryption is tested by me)*
